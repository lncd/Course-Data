Sustainability may be viewed as an attempt to harmonise the economic, social and environmental dimensions of a general developmental strategy for food and energy production. This strategy is now a key feature of governmental policies world wide. A major challenge to governments and producers for the 21st century is to change the patterns of production and consumption to achieve sustainable development objectives without compromising the future viability of natural and human systems. Businesses will need to develop their own strategies to further improve their products and processes in response to consumer demand and the needs of the environment.

These may be political, social, economic, moral and ethical, environmental or production issues. ','This integrative module is designed to encourage the student to investigate in depth the current agricultural and environmental issues. Such issues may have a current or future impact on crop, livestock or non-food crop production. Examples of potential study areas that may be addressed include: the future of genetically modified crops; the impact on crop production on biodiversity; management of climate change and its impact on production and perhaps the social and political dimensions of water use. Debate may ensue around whether or not genetic improvement is critical to address issues of food security for a growing world population, or whether crops are a central component of agro-ecosystems and economies worldwide, and as a consequence, there is a need to consider agriculture and environment on a global scale as well as local. Students may also investigate the application of the latest and emergent biotechnology options and bioformatics for crop improvement and production.

This will provide the student with a clear understanding of the complex and multi-disciplinary nature of the industry. An industry which demands a wide range of skills and depth of knowledge, but with an understanding of how these can be applied.  Integrated farming is an approach to food production which combines traditional farming methods with modern technology, in an environmentally friendly manner. IFM aims to ensure high standards of food production with minimum environmental impact; it integrates beneficial natural processes, landscape maintenance, enhancement of wildlife habitats and increased biodiversity into modern farming practices. The concept is a whole farm, long term strategy.

The module will introduce the student to advanced farm business techniques through a ?live? farm. \rIt is expected that the student will construct a fully detailed farm business plan (including financial statements and budgets) as part of a land tenure agreement. This plan will encompass waste and energy managements, cropping and environmental schemes. It will reflect the current legislation and government and European support mechanisms.

Environmental schemes (ELS and HLS) to enhance the biodiversity together with diversification options, may be considered by the student; machinery management selection to equip the production system, (using prior knowledge of finance sources), and sprayer technology, will be studied to further inform the plan.

Supply chains are central to environmental change and to sustainable business practice. Learning how to manage them and their impacts presents fundamental organisational challenges.\rManaging operations efficiently whether on the farm or in a factory is essential for any business to compete successfully. It is a factor within the supply chain and usually involves project management, with the aim of maintaining and raising quality and improving efficiency in an increasing lean environment.\rManaging people, human resource management, is concerned with the effective management and utilisation of human resources in organisations. For most organisations, human resources are their greatest assets and their optimal utilisation is the key to competitive advantage in today?s increasingly harsh economic environment. It is now so crucial to success, that is it no longer the sole responsibility of personnel management, and is the responsibility of all managers.\r','Supply Chain Management\rThe student will establish how supply chain management is extending across the total product life cycle- from production in the field, through primary processing, further processing, distribution, marketing and after-market support to end-of-life processing.\rThe 3 themes that will be examined are supply chain policy, supply chain practice and supply chain improvement with the view of an integrated supply chain.

This will include an analysis of the technological capabilities of these devices, how mobile systems and devices differ from conventional ones, and how these differences must be taken into account during the design process.

The unit will adopt standards based approaches to specification and design of distributed systems and will cover the RFC strategy to the adoption of solutions.

The impact of human activities, including food processing, on biological systems and the conflicting pressures on land use for access, food, energy, landscape and biodiversity will be debated.
